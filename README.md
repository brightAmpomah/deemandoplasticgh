Deemando is a Ghanaian manufacturing company that produces plastic and rubber-based products, including polybags, sachet bags, and shopping bags. The company supports local businesses by providing reliable packaging solutions that meet everyday commercial and industrial needs. This website focuses on clear navigation, structured content, and professional presentation suitable for business and industrial audiences.

## The Project
Created a website the company I work for called Deemando Company Limited, The project is completely built start off from the customer landing page, product page, product detail page, sales page and Admin page. I used VS Code editor for the entire project.

I was be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

I build out the project to the designs inside the `/deemando` folder on my desktop.
The designs are in PNG and SVG static format. Using these formats means to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


All the required images for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

I also included an import from google fonts and static svg files for the required fonts and images needed for the projects.

There is also a `README.md` file containing a step by step creating the projects.

## Building your project

I used the best workflow that you feel comfortable with me building the project. Below are the processes:

1. Initialize my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo called `deemandoplastics` making it easier to share my code with the colleagues when needed help.
2. Configure my repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL.
3. Look through the designs templete I'd downloaded from `banani.ai` to start planning out how to tackle the project.
4. Before adding any styles, structured my content with HTML. Wrote the HTML first helped me to create well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family`, `font-size` and `color`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section and different pages once am happy with what i have done.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, I used GitHub pages to host my project for free.
